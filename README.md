This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.
It was made to demonstrate the difficulty I'm facing implementing this [stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42556725)
into an Ionic 3 project.

### How to use this template with the Ionic CLI:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Then, to run it, cd into `ionicChartJs` and run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```

If you want to run the app on an actual mobile device:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
